# How to manage cluster in kubernetes 
1. kubeadm ----> command manage or operate cluster / cluster command 
2. kubectl ----> manage update create your resource in kubernetes / client command

# what is the way to pass instruction 
1. imperative --- using kubernetes command  
2. Declerative ---- using kubernetes yaml 
3. GUI ---- K9S LANCE kubernetesUI

# HOW TO manage kubernetes container 
working with pods ---- kubernetes manage pods ---- pods is manage container 
pod::: pod is smallest unit in kubernetes to manage your container. pod is provide and manage security context, storage and
connectivity, pod can be single or a multiple, pod can be use for small application 

pod failure and manage kuberntes usages diffrent workflow 
- Deployment ----> most of application manage by using Deployment. pod scale, update rolling and rollout 
- Daemonsets ---> Ensure pod is running on ecery node use cases network storage logging monitor 
- ReplicaSet ---> same for scale, Deployment uses replicaset for scale
- Statefulset ---> if your application manageing states for transition so that application un using it like database or proxy and LB 
- Jobs ----> for running batch jobs 
- Cron ----> for cron schdule 

for kubernetes access and expose method 
1. ClusterIp :::: only access from kubernetes cluster machines 
2. NodePort  :::: access from node ip but port range 30000-32767
3. Loadbalancer ::::: using cloud provider lb or external lb ---aws ALB azu

pods schduling in kubernetes cluster ( Assing pods to node )
kuberntes schdule purpose kube-schduler used. auto schdule
you require manual intervation for pod Deployment. 
why need this to assign pods to nodes ? 
 example let taken with problem statement: 
 1. they have 20 nodes cluster in this manage
    - they have uncertain hardware avalibility like some server have 32 GB Ram and 4 CPU and some have 2 cpu 8 GB 
      ram, apart of this 128 Gb Ram and 32 cpu. 
    - manage application dedidcated node will assign for java , python, machine learning apps 
    - kubernetes storage pod, monitoring pod, logging, kubernetes UI, nexus sonar pods or CI/CD tools they want 
      to run this on particuler group of node 

- node selector ----> on the basis on node label match assign pods 
- taint and tolrations
- affinity and anti-affinity
